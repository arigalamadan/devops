1. A servlet container is a specialized web server that supports servlet execution.
2. It combines the basic functionality of a web server with certain Java/servlet specific optimizations and extensions (such as an integrated Java runtime environment, and the ability to automatically translate specific URLs into servlet requests).
3. Individual servlets are registered with a servlet container, providing the container with information such as the functionality, the URL used for identification.
4. The servlet container then initializes the servlet as necessary and delivers requests to the servlet as they arrive.
5. Many containers can dynamically add and remove servlets from the system, allowing new servlets to quickly be deployed or removed without affecting other servlets running from the same container.
6. Servlet containers are also referred to as web containers or web engines.
